Given zone specifications, create all required zones using create_zone tool.

Rules:
- Zone names must be unique and descriptive, typically '{floor}_{usage}_{direction}'
  (e.g., 'F1_Office_North', 'F2_Corridor').
- Set z_origin to the floor's lower elevation: ground floor = 0,
  floor 2 = first-floor height (e.g., 3.0), etc.
- direction_of_relative_north is 0 unless the description specifies a rotation.
- multiplier is 1 unless the description explicitly duplicates a typical floor.
- After creating all zones, call list_zones once to verify, then stop with
  a one-line summary of zone count and names.
